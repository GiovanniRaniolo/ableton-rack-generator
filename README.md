## 📑 Abstract (Sommario)

The **AI Ableton Rack Generator** is a deterministic engine designed to bridge the gap between high-level musical intent (Natural Language) and low-level Digital Signal Processing (Internal XML Parameters). 

Unlike traditional "AI assistants," this system utilizes a **Scientific Mapping Model** that ensures 100% parameter compliance, zero file corruption, and professional-grade sound design gestures through **Semantic Clustering** and **Surgical Device Initialization**.

## 1. The Core Problem: Parameter Hallucination

Large Language Models (LLMs) often guess parameter names (e.g., calling distortion "Drive" when the XML requires `Stage1_Shaper_Amount`). This results in broken `.adg` files. 

Our engine eliminates this through an **Internal Authority Map (V67)** that bridges semantic intent to exact XML attributes.

## 3. Breakthrough Methodology

### C. Semantic Clustering Engine (The IQ Boost)
The engine no longer maps parameters in isolation. It analyzes the **intent** of a macro (e.g., "Growl") and automatically clusters relevant parameters from different devices (e.g., Auto Filter Resonance + Roar Amount) into a unified multi-device gesture.

### D. Global Inverse Gain Compensation
To preserve headroom, the system calculates the "Local Gain Delta" of distortion stages and automatically injects compensating attenuation into final Utility stages, ensuring professional 10/10 gain staging.

### E. Surgical Initialization (Pro Intent)
Common parameters unmapped to macros are not left to chance. The AI provides "Surgical Defaults" (e.g., specific filter types, sidechain timings, or vinyl noise levels) that define the professional "soul" of the rack from the start.
